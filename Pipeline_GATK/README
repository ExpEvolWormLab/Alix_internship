Pipeline to lauch GATK pipeline to call variants usign tools from GATK v.4.5.0.0

1. bash launch_GATK.part1.sh folder output_directory
launch_GATK.part1.sh :  Pre-processing step (MarkDuplicates, AddOrReplaceReadGroups, BaseRecalibrator, ApplyBQSR)
			Variant calling step  (HaplotypeCaller)
folder - folder where .bam file are stored
ouput_directory - name of the output directory (doesn't have to exist)

2. find -name *reheader.g.vcf.gz > .list | sed "s/\.\//$pwd/g"
Need to create a .list before running launch_GATK.part2.sh
.list - contains all paths of g.vcf.gz we want to combine

3. bash launch_GATK.part2.sh .list output_directory
launch_GATK.part2.sh :  Genotyping step (CombineGVCFs, GenotypeGVCFs)
			Filtration step (SelectVariants, VariantFiltration, bcftools : (view, filter))
.list -  contains all paths of g.vcf.gz we want to combine
ouput_directory - name of the output directory (doesn't have to exist)
