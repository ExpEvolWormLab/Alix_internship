Codes R and bash to launch GBLUP analysis 
It is an automatised procedure, users have just to run :
  For Multivariate analysis :
    bash launch_GBLUP_pop.sh file.tsv
  For Univariate analysis :
    bash launch_GBLUP_pop.Univariate.sh file.tsv
file.tsv - tsv file, first column path of the vcf file to use for a pop, second column name of the pop


DETAILS : 
launch_GBLUP_pop.sh - launch launch_GBLUP.sh
launch_GBLUP.sh - launch 1-Kinship.R :  compute kinship matrix in three differents ways (Hoffman, NOIA, VanRaden)
                                        ouputs : *_snp_positions.csv - SNP position
                                                 *_t_convert_genotype.csv - Transposed genotype matrix
                                                 Kinship_matrix_VanRaden - csv file VanRaden kinship matrix
                                                 Kinship_matrix_Luke - csv file Hoffman kinship matrix
                                                 Kinship_matrix_noia - csv file Noia kinship matrix
                  launch launch_GBLUP.parallele.sh : launch rest of the procedure using the three way of computing GRM
