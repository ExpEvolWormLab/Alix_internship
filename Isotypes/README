Set of script to obtain isotypes groups

1-NaN_Distribution.R : 
	Should use as file Hard filtred vcf to just consider PASS SNPs
	ouput : Na_distribution.tsv
		histo_NA.pdf : use it to set a cutoff

2-Concordance_matrix.R:
	Should use as file Hard filtred vcf to just consider PASS SNPs
	Concordance = Number of SNPs with same allele in both lines/Number of SNPs observed in both lines
	ouput : Doublons.csv : contains lines sequenced twice
		matrix_concordance.by_hand*tsv 

3-Set_cutoffs_Isotypes.R:
	ouput : Removed_line_concordance.csv - Store names of lines belonging to known isotypes by with LowConcordance
		Removed_line_doublon.csv - Store name of the line which was considered twice by mistake
		matrix_concordance.by_hand.0.982.corrected.tsv - concordance matrix corrected, remove known isotypes inferior to the cutoff (0.982 is the NaN cutoff)

4-Pb_Isotypes.R:
	compute isotypes groups and spot ones which are shared between several groups and compute a new concordance matrix
	outputs : matrix_concordance.by_hand.corrected1.tsv - corrected concordance matrix, ie without pb lines
		  Removed_line_isotype_groups.csv - store lines' names for one shared between groups

5-Isotypes.R
	output : isotype_groups.csv - groups of isotypes
 		 Distribution_isotypes.csv - Number of lines in each pop which belong to an insotype group
		 correspondance_isotypes.csv - Lines belonging to an isotype group and the line which represents it
		 Removed_line_isotypes.csv - Store names of lines which were removed because they belong to an isotype group
